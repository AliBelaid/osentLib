Learn slowly. Use ChatGPT only to clarify concepts not to solve labs for you.\n\n\n\n**Introduction**  \nI want to share something for anyone starting in cybersecurity.  \nI spent two years learning and failing and taking random courses without guidance.  \nEverything here is based on my personal experience and I simply wish someone had told me this earlier.\n\n\n\n**About the usual beginner certificates**  \nLike many people I started with the classic sequence  \nSecurity Plus then Network Plus then CCNA.\n\nThese certificates are not completely useless.  \nThey can help some people build a general IT foundation or give structure if you have no background.  \nBut for me they did not prepare me for real security work.\n\nSecurity Plus was mostly governance and theory.  \nNetwork Plus was very basic.  \nCCNA focused on being a network engineer not a security analyst.\n\nPeople often say you need these certificates to understand the OSI model or the TCP model.  \nHonestly you can learn the basic idea of OSI and TCP from one good video or article.  \nAnd even after all the learning and labs I have done I can tell you it is very hard to directly map real attacks to OSI layers in your daily work.  \nAlmost nobody does this except very advanced people with many years of experience and even then it is in a very indirect way.\n\nFor beginners you only need a simple high level picture of what each layer does.  \nBecause of that using OSI as the main reason to take long and expensive entry level certificates does not make much sense in my opinion.  \nYou will get much more value from real labs and real security work.\n\n\n\n**What actually matters: real practice**  \nAfter taking stronger certifications like OffSec OSDA and INE eCIR I understood the real problem.  \nBeginners do not lack theory.  \nThey lack practice.\n\nYou really learn cybersecurity when you attack systems and defend them and investigate incidents and fix things in real labs.  \nThis is where everything starts to make sense.\n\n\n\n**The best starting point I can honestly recommend**  \nFor a beginner I strongly recommend starting with Hack The Box Academy.\n\nDefensive path  \n[https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst)\n\nOffensive path  \n[https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist)\n\nThese two paths are general starting points.  \nYou choose defense or offense based on your personal interest.  \nNo one can decide the right choice for you and both are valid.\n\n\n\n**What I personally did as my own path**  \nIn my own journey I completed OffSec OSDA.  \nIt was the best and strongest course I have ever taken in my life.  \nAfter finishing it I finally understood how cybersecurity really works as a whole and how the different parts connect together.  \nBecause of that clarity I was able to recognize that DFIR is the field that fits me the most.\n\nSo OSDA helped me see my direction  \nbut that was my personal path  \nnot a rule for everyone.\n\nHowever OffSec is extremely expensive.  \nThe only reason I could take OSDA is because my organization paid for the full package including two exam attempts.  \nWith their strong training I passed in about three months.\n\nFor most beginners the price is not realistic.  \nSo even if the quality is amazing I do not recommend my exact path as a starting point.\n\n\n\n**Why Hack The Box is a more realistic start**  \nWhile preparing for OSDA I used Hack The Box labs and they were excellent.  \nSometimes the hands on training even felt stronger.  \nThey are also much more affordable and their reputation in the security community is growing fast.  \nThe skills you get there are real and respected.\n\nFrom what I remember they might have separate plans for labs and courses or bundles that combine both so please check their current options because my information is a few months old.\n\n\n\n**Struggling at first is normal**  \nYou will probably struggle with these courses at the beginning.  \nNot because you are stupid but because you are building your foundations from zero.  \nThis is normal.  \nWhether you choose offense or defense the first phase will feel heavy and confusing.  \nThat is simply how your brain builds a new structure.\n\nKeep going and after some time the concepts will start to connect together.\n\n\n\n**How your path becomes clear later**  \nSomething important happens after you finish one of these paths.  \nYour career direction becomes much clearer.  \nYou finally understand how the cybersecurity field works and how roles connect to each other.\n\nFor me once I finished OSDA I could clearly see that DFIR is my path  \nfor you it might be governance  \nincident response  \nblue team  \nor something else.\n\nThe key point is that real hands on exposure makes your path appear naturally  \nnot through theory  \nbut through experience.\n\n\n\n**A note about programming basics**  \nI also assume that you have at least basic programming knowledge.  \nYou do not need to be a developer but you should understand simple things like variables and conditions and loops in a language such as C plus plus or Java or Python.\n\nWithout these fundamentals some of the security courses will feel like a nightmare.  \nWith them the content becomes much easier to understand.\n\n\n\n**How to use ChatGPT in a healthy way**  \nPlease do not use ChatGPT to solve labs or write answers for you.  \nIf you let AI do the work you will not build your own analytical muscles.\n\nUse ChatGPT only to explain concepts in a simpler way  \nor to clarify something that you already tried to understand by yourself.\n\nLearning how to research on your own is one of the most important skills in cybersecurity.  \nReading documentation and articles and searching smartly is a core skill for any SOC analyst or security engineer.  \nBuild this skill early.\n\n\n\n**Respect slow learning**  \nCybersecurity cannot be learned in a hurry.  \nTake your time.  \nLearn slowly.\n\nFeeling lost and stuck and confused is completely normal at the beginning.  \nIf you stay consistent with slow and steady learning for a few months your progress will surprise you and seniors will be able to see your growth through your work.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion with clear steps**\n\n1. Choose one path on Hack The Box defensive or offensive and commit to it.\n2. Study the material and labs slowly every day for at least three months while building basic programming and research skills.\n3. Use Google and documentation first and use ChatGPT only to clarify ideas that you still do not understand.\n\nIf you do this you will build a solid foundation much faster than you expect.  \nThis is just my experience. It can be right or wrong.  \nBut it is exactly what I wish someone had told me when I first started.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1p1soiw/my_honest_advice_to_beginners_in_cybersecurity/","author":"kratos2k2k","source":"Reddit","publishedAt":"2025-11-20T03:26:19Z","engagementCount":298,"metadata":{"upvotes":248,"comments":50,"subreddit":"cybersecurity","awards":0}},{"id":"1qy8rg1","title":"For those who’ve landed jobs in cybersecurity, what made you stand out to get hired?","content":"A lot of people here are focused on how terrible the job market is and how nearly impossible it is to land a job (which is pretty true),\n\nBut I’d like to hear the **success stories** of those who have been hired. **What experience, projects, and other things got you hired?** \n\nAny field is fine, but I’m mostly interested in those in **cloud computing.**","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1qy8rg1/for_those_whove_landed_jobs_in_cybersecurity_what/","author":"cqffe","source":"Reddit","publishedAt":"2026-02-07T08:42:33Z","engagementCount":353,"metadata":{"upvotes":186,"comments":167,"subreddit":"cybersecurity","awards":0}},{"id":"1n7zi66","title":"Cybersecurity?

I would like to share my story with anyone interested as I represent the lowest percentage chance of success. \n\nI will try to be precise and not to ramble in self aggrandizement, so I will break everything down in order for you to extract what you need at this time from it. \n\nFurthermore, it is very easy to call bullshit on this story (understandably) based on the speed at which I was able to hit my checkpoints, so to provide proof without giving up my identity I’ve also attached two pictures of two posts I made asking Reddit for help beginning my journey. \n\nUnfortunately, the posts were taken down because I was a noob, but they were cached and have a time stamp on them.\n\nIf you are struggling with this economy, unable to find work or not sure where to start during a career pivot I’m reaching out to you. \n\nKey points:\n\n\\- No degree or post secondary education\n\n\\- No prior experience\n\n\\- No family connections\n\n\\- No nepotism or handouts\n\n\\- No wealthy family, inheritance or time abundance\n\nCertificates:\n\n\\- CompTIA Security +\n\n\\- CompTIA Network +\n\nTraining / educational materials:\n\n\\- Coursera cybersecurity fundamentals\n\n\\- TryHackMe eJPT learning path\n\n\\- Udemy Angela Yu’s Python course\n\nGoal:\n\n\\- Inspire someone else crawling Reddit in my exact position having an intense quarter life crisis feeling fucked for life about the decisions they’ve made\n\nBackstory:\n\nI have no post secondary education other than a diploma in performing arts. I threw myself into being a professional athlete earlier on and it didn’t work out. From here I figured I liked performance so I tried acting, I got a diploma in performing arts and actually had a pretty successful run as a professional actor.\n\nI began landing bigger shows and bigger roles when the industry got nuked by the writer’s strike. This threw me into despair as I had always done what was most fun, disliked academic facilities and also performed poorly in school.\n\nI was now facing a reality in which I might have to get a “real” job and confronting the insecurity that the reason I pursued all these low percentage careers was because I was too stupid to do anything academic, post sec or “normal”.\n\nI won’t dive too much into it unless asked, but my upbringing was awful and resulted in poor academic performance as I was being badly abused at home which made it quite hard to focus during the day time at school.\n\nWith this challenge of having all of my passion avenues cut off I needed to do some soul searching. I was lucky to have landed a role big enough to allow me to be unemployed for about 1.5 years. During this time, I read almost everyday at the library searching for a more stable passion.\n\nOne day watching YouTube, I stumbled across Shawn Ryan’s interview with Ryan Montgomery in which Ryan explained his profession as an ethical hacker. Once again I found myself allured to a low percentage job, but it sparked that sense of passion again.\n\nI didn’t want to fall for a buzz word or hype train so I figured I needed to learn the fundamentals. As you’ll see in my screenshots, after heavy contemplation and planning I had laid a path out for myself.\n\nI studied for the Security + first because I liked cybersecurity most which was actually an idiotic decision since the CompTIA trifecta is supposed to be obtain from A+ upwards.\n\nI set myself a 6 week deadline by buying the exam voucher and the book, which was again quite stupid. I was able to pass by 2 points on my first attempt.\n\nAfter this I realised I knew a lot of buzzwords and concept outlines but very little about actual networking fundamentals. So, I bought the Network + and decided to give a 3 month timeline this time. This was also 800+ pages vs 600+ for Sec+.\n\nDuring this time I realised that I needed more than just certificates, I needed actual work experience to create the illusion that I was worth anyone’s time up against CS grads that were competing for entry level positions. \n\nI then started scanning the job market for lowest entry point into IT since even help desk tier 1 often necessitated either 1 year experience or a related degree. \n\nI landed on Geek Squad, BestBuy as a place to start my narrative. I use the word narrative because I often use prior experience to tell the story of what I’m trying to achieve to employers as they interview me.\n\nProblem was even this position was apparently competitive. So I started selling TVs for them. After a while I got to know the key players that could get me into GS and I convinced them to give me a shot. There was no opening but I essentially kept harassing them in a polite but persistent way until they put me into the GS section.\n\nGreat, now I was fixing computers and having hands on experience with what I was reading about in my study materials. Every lunch break I would study and after work I would study at the library near BestBuy. \n\nIf the library was closed this was not a valid excuse to go home, so I studied at McDonalds nearby since they were open later. \n\nDuring study and full time work with garbage pay at BestBuy I spammed helpdesk applications. I was able to hook an interview with a smaller IT company. The job was fully remote and about $2 per hour more than I made. What a win. The owner seemed somewhat a disorganized and overloaded so time between interviews and decisions took ages. The CFO wasn’t fully bought into me working with them, so I targeted a conversation with the CEO privately.\n\nI said to him I could see he was stressed and was just curious what they were working on and if I could be of assistance in anyway, free of charge, for experience. I knew this would be a good way to build rapport and trust. He said they were trying to build a new SharePoint site but were struggling to understand how it all works and he was too busy to do it himself.\n\nI asked if I could try and if he could give me a week. He agreed. I then spent all my time studying SharePoint and was able to build them a site. I don’t think it was overly impressive, but since they weren’t familiar with SharePoint it worked and looked pretty so they thought I was a genius.\n\nThis boosted trust and proved value and I got the job. I worked with this employer for about 7 months until I was approached by a recruiter who believed in me for some reason. Again, not a humble brag, but I did not see anything enticing about my profile that a recruiter would seek me out to work.\n\nWe had some chats, he liked me and then pitched me for a job. I made it to the 3rd and final round of interviews with a global clothing company, but lost out to someone with more experience. No hard feelings, I knew I was just some nobody without a degree and only really 1 job to show for. A valuable piece of feedback I received was that I made their decision very difficult as they liked my personality a lot. This was a tool to me that could boost my confidence. If I’m not the smartest or most qualified, maybe I’m the most likeable?\n\nSecond chance, recruiter pitched me again and this time I closed the deal. I was working for a medical company this time and was handed a lot of responsibilities. We had a KPI dashboard and I always stayed top 3 most tickets closed. This made my contribution very visible and the bosses sat behind me in an open concept office so they could see how I dealt with customers. This job helped my confidence a lot and the bosses loved me, but unfortunately I was on a contract and they didn’t have the money to convert me to full time. My contract expired (6 months) and they renewed me because they liked me, but they made no promise of full time or job security. That sucked and made me feel scared and dispensable. \n\nI used this fear to begin job searching again, now with a more robust resume on my hands. I stumbled across a system administrator job which was L3. I could recognize I was entirely unqualified for this job, however it happened to be for a food company I had previously bartended for. \n\nI remember their mission focus being on people and personality, thought “fuck it” and threw a hail Mary shot in applying for it. \n\nIn the application process I noted that I had worked for them before and therefore already knew how their systems worked. This hooked enough attention to get me an asynchronous video interview where I could use my performance ability to showcase my personality and passion. Having previous acting experience this works well for me as you’re constantly required to perform to a camera in your house.\n\nI got a 2nd interview with humans and did much the same routine. I got a 3rd in person interview and was asked to take a personality test which was reviewed live in the interview. I had a 4th interview with the CEOs in which they bamboozled me with salary negotiations. I had a feeling this would happen so brought market averages to the table, this allowed me to secure a salary jump of 50%.\n\nI worked with this company for another 10 months absorbing experience and even writing them software for internal use and data analytics automation. This bolstered my confidence to a place where I felt ready to break into cybersecurity, whatever that looked like. I had also been mistreated a couple of times by the director at the company, so I began looking again. This time I knew this part of the jump would be hard and I’d already failed resume spamming for cybersecurity roles many times.\n\nNew approach - networking. I volunteered at a cybersecurity convention. Here I spent much of the day talking with CISOs and devs. I was partnered up on my volunteer duty with a woman named Lily. Lily periodically was in and out of the duty area on her phone. I asked if everything was ok and if she needs relief I can assist as I thought it might be a family matter. \n\nShe said everything was fine, it’s just a few people had left her work and since she was the senior manager she had to deal with it. I asked her what her job was and she was a senior security manager. I laughed at the serendipity and said if she needs replacements to let me know. She took this seriously and said, “ok” with a contemplative expression. \n\nThrough out the day she asked me questions about my passions, interests and where I was trying to go with cybersecurity. I could tell that an interview had begun and I performed accordingly. By the end of the day she got my details and forwarded me to her director. \n\nHe ended up reaching out and we got on a call. He liked me and passed me to another manager who also liked me, I was then passed to a partner and he liked me too. After much deliberation, yesterday I received an email with a letter of employment and a contract and that’s my story! If you read to the end, I hope this was a source of inspiration for you. I truly felt worthless at the start of my journey and doomed to never buy a house, have a humiliatingly simple job and live a life without passion. I continued to persist and took any win no matter how small, as a sign of progress. Truly anyone could do this, it’s just not as simple as A to B.\n\nObstacles:\n\n\\- Imposter syndrome, everyone gets it. Your ACTIONS count. It’s ok to feel like a completely unqualified loser, apply anyway. That’s the only thing that affects your navigation in the world, depression and self doubt be damned it can not hold you back if you move as if you didn’t have it. Many more qualified people than myself fall short because I have more confidence and I KNOW they’re better than me. This is how you become “stuck”.\n\n\\- Degree, multiple employers have told me they don’t give a shit.\n\n\\- Technical proficiency, most places request 10x the proficiency they actually require and the further you move up the less hands on you have with the tech. This is GRC territory and people management, so if you can present yourself well and show potential, they’re willing to invest in you.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityJobs/comments/1pug4z7/got_a_cybersecurity_job_in_2_years_with_no/","author":"cybern00bster","source":"Reddit","publishedAt":"2025-12-24T06:04:14Z","engagementCount":304,"metadata":{"upvotes":241,"comments":63,"subreddit":"CyberSecurityJobs","awards":0}},{"id":"1ocgrdv","title":"How to Start Learning Cybersecurity as a Complete Beginner?","content":"Hi everyone,\n\nI’m completely new to tech and cybersecurity, and I want to start learning from scratch.
